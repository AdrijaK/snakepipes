snakePipes are our in-house, flexible and powerful workflows built using `snakemake <snakemake.readthedocs.io>`__ that simplify the analysis of NGS data.

Workflows
----------

- DNA-mapping
- ChIP-seq (normal and allele-specific)
- RNA-seq (normal and allele-specific)
- scRNA-seq
- ATAC-seq

Installation
-------------

Currently the workflows don't require installation of the scripts. Simply clone this github repository
and modify the configuration files under `shared/organisms` and `shared/paths.yaml` with your own paths.

Documentation
--------------

For documentation on setup and usage, please visit our `read the docs page <https://snakepipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
