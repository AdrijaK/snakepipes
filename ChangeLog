version 0.0.1 - March 23, 2016 - Fabian Kilpert
- initial version

version 0.1.0 - June 15, 2016 - Andreas Richter
- added --fastqc and --bw-binsize parameters to DNA-mapping wrapper script
- additional organisms are now supported by adding new genome.py files
- defined (effective) genome size as (genome length)-(number of 'N's) in genome.py files
- simplified cluster submission by taking 'threads' parameter from rule definition, removed cluster.yaml
- added DNA-mapping example configuration yaml file
- added function get_fragment_length() to DNA-mapping internals.snakefile to parse median insert size from Picard output
- added deepTools_qc.snakefile as one common snakefile for all deepTools rules,
    moved all deepTools rules from ChIP-seq Snakefile and computeGCBias.snakefile
- moved include statements of module snakefiles from rules.snakefile to DNA-mapping Snakefile to simplify structure, removed rules.snakefile
- renamed functions do_TrimGalore(trim) and do_InsertSizeMetrics(paired) in DNA-mapping Snakefile
- renamed load_organisms.snakefile to load_organism_data.py
- removed debugging.snakefile as it was not used by any pipeline
- removed --local-cores parameter from all wrapper scripts as there are no local snakemake rules defined
- many small other changes
