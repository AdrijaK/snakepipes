version 0.1.0 - June 15, 2016:

shared/:
* shared/cluster.yaml removed as not required when taking {threads} parameter from each rule
* shared/debugging.snakefile removed as not used by pipeline
* renamed shared/load_organisms.snakefile to shared/load_organism_data.py
* defined (effective) genome size as (genome length)-(number of 'N's), added additional files to genome data in shared/organisms/
* shared/rules/deepTools.snakefiles:
  - added file as one common snakefile for all deepTools rules
  - moved rules from computeGCBias.snakefile and all deepTools rules from workflows/ChIP-seq/Snakefile

workflows/:
* workflows/ChIP-seq/ChIP-seq + workflows/DNA-mapping/DNA-mapping + workflows/rMATS/rMATS.sh:
  - removed --local-cores parameter as there are no local snakemake rules used
  - simplified cluster submission by taking {threads} parameter from rule definition
  - added --fastqc and --bw-binsize parameters
* workflows/DNA-mapping/Snakefile:
  - moved includes of module snakefiles from rules.snakefile to main snakefile to simplify structure
  - renamed functions do_TrimGalore(trim) and do_InsertSizeMetrics(paired)
  - several minor changes
* workflows/DNA-mapping/example.config.yaml added
* workflows/DNA-mapping/internals.snakefile: added function get_fragment_length() to parse median insert size from Picard output
* workflows/DNA-mapping/rules.snakefile removed as includes of module snakefiles were moved to main snakefile
